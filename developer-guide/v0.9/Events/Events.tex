\chapter {\Large{Event Notifiers}}

Siminov framework provides few event notifiers which gets triggered based on particular action. Application have to provide implementation for these event notifiers and register them with Siminov.

\section{ISiminov Events} It provide API's related to life cycle of Siminov framework

		\par
		\textbf{Example:} ISiminov Events Notifier
			\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{Resources/isiminov_events_notifier.txt}


		\begin{enumerate}

			\item \small \textbf{First Time Siminov Initialized - firstTimSiminovInitialized()}: It is triggered when Siminov is initialized for first time. In this you can perform tasks which are related to initialization of things only first time of application starts.

					\par
					\textbf{Example:}
	
					\par
					 Preparing initial data for application, which is required by application in its life time, Since it is to be done only once, therefore we will use firstTimeSiminovInitialized API.

						\parbox[t]{.8\linewidth}{
							\fontsize{11pt}{11pt}\selectfont % The first argument for fontsize is the font size of the text and the second is the line spacing - you may need to play with these for your particular title
							\vspace*{0.1cm} % Space between the start of the title and the top of the grey box
		
							\hfill \textbf{Note} \\
							This API will be triggered only once when Siminov is initialized first time.
				
							\vspace*{0.0cm} % Space between the end of the title and the bottom of the grey box
						}
					}

					\end{center}


			\item \small \textbf{Siminov Initialized - siminovInitialized()}: It is triggered whenever Siminov is initialized. 

					\begin{center}
						\colorbox{grey}{
						\parbox[t]{.8\linewidth}{
							\fontsize{11pt}{11pt}\selectfont % The first argument for fontsize is the font size of the text and the second is the line spacing - you may need to play with these for your particular title
							\vspace*{0.1cm} % Space between the start of the title and the top of the grey box
		
							\hfill \textbf{Note} \\
								This doesnot gets triggered when Siminov is first time initialized, instead of this firstTimeSiminovInitialized APIwill be triggered.

							\vspace*{0.0cm} % Space between the end of the title and the bottom of the grey box
						}
					}

					\end{center}

		
			\item \small \textbf{Siminov Stopped - siminovStopped()}: It is triggered when Siminov is shutdown.


		\end{enumerate}



\section{IDatabaseEvents} It provide API's related to database operations.


		\par
		\textbf{Example:} IDatabaseEvents Notifier
			\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{Resources/idatabase_events_notifier.txt}


		\begin{enumerate}

			\item \small \textbf{Database Created - databaseCreated(DatabaseDescriptor)}: It is triggered when database is created based on schema defined in DatabaseDescriptor.si.xml file. This API provides DatabaseDescriptor object for which database is created.

			\item \small \textbf{Database Dropped - databaseDropped(DatabaseDescriptor)}: It is triggered when database is dropped. This API provides DatabaseDescriptor object for which database is dropped.


			\item \small \textbf{Table Created - tableCreated(DatabaseMappingDescriptor)}: It is triggered when a table is created in database. This API provides DatabaseMappingDescriptor object which describes table structure.


			\item \small \textbf{Table Dropped - tableDropped(DatabaseMappingDescriptor)}: It is triggered when a table is deleted from database. This API provides DatabaseMappingDescriptor object for which table is dropped.


			\item \small \textbf{Index Created - indexCreated(DatabaseMappingDescriptor, Index)}: It is triggered when a index is created on table. This API provides DatabaseMappingDescriptor and Index object which defines table and index structure.

			
			\item \small \textbf{Index Dropped - indexDropped(DatabaseMappingDescriptor, Index)}: It is triggered when a index is dropped from table. This API provides DatabaseMappingDescriptor and Index object which defines table and index for which index is dropped.

		\end{enumerate}
